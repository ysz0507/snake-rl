# Disclaimer
This fork was created as an Assignment of the Neural Network course at the [UiT](https://en.uit.no/startsida). 
The goal was to convert a Tensorflow Project to PyTorch. So besides some new graphs and some refactoring there are no additional features.
Keep this in mind if you want to use this repository.
